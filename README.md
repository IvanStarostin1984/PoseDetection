# PoseDetection

PoseDetection is a minimal showcase for human pose estimation. It detects body
keypoints from a webcam and serves them through a small web app. See
[docs/tech-challenge.txt](docs/tech-challenge.txt) for the original assignment.

Clone the repository, run `.codex/setup.sh` to install tooling, then check the
code:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd PoseDetection
